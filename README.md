# Longitudinal Predictors of Change in Health Behaviors

## Techniques Used

- **Longitudinal Survey Design:** Tracking changes over time.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing and describing the data.
- **Data Collection via Online Questionnaires:** Gathering data from participants.
- **ANOVAs with Repeated Measures:** Analyzing variance in repeated measures.
- **Structural Equation Modeling (SEM):** Modeling complex relationships between variables.
- **Linear Regression:** Assessing the relationship between variables.
- **SPSS Statistics Software:** Performing statistical analysis.
- **Lisrel Statistics Software:** Conducting structural equation modeling.

## Summary

In this project, data was collected from 163 first-year university students at the beginning and end of their first semester. The analysis includes:

- **ANOVAs and Repeated Measures Analyses:** To assess changes over time.
- **Structural Equation Modeling:** To examine relationships between variables.
- **Linear Regressions:** To analyze the impact of different factors on health behavior changes.

The study explores the impact of initial health behaviors, parental influence, and living arrangements on changes in health behaviors and expectations. The findings provide insights into the dynamics of health behavior during the transition to university life.
