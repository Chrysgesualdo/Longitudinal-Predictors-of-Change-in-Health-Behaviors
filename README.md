# Longitudinal Predictors of Change in Health Behaviors

## Techniques Used

- **Longitudinal Survey Design:** Tracking changes over time.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing and describing the data.
- **Data Collection via Online Questionnaires:** Gathering data from participants.
- **ANOVAs with Repeated Measures:** Analyzing variance in repeated measures.
- **Structural Equation Modeling (SEM):** Modeling complex relationships between variables.
- **Linear Regression:** Assessing the relationship between variables.
- **SPSS Statistics Software:** Performing statistical analysis.
- **Lisrel Statistics Software:** Conducting structural equation modeling.

## Summary

In this project, I investigated changes in health behaviors and expectations of first-year university students during their first semester. Using a longitudinal survey design, I collected from 163 students at the beginning and end of the semester. I performed ANOVAs, repeated measures analyses, structural equation modeling, and linear regressions using SPSS and Lisrel. The study examined the impact of initial behaviors, parental influence, and living arrangements on these changes, providing insights into health behavior dynamics during the transition to university life.
