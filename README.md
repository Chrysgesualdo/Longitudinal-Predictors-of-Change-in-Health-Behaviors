# Project Title: Longitudinal Predictors of Change in Health Behaviors

- Longitudinal survey design
- Descriptive statistics
- Data collection via online questionnaires
- ANOVAs with repeated measures
- Structural equation modeling
- Linear regression
- SPSS Statistics Software
- Lisrel Statistics Software

## Summary:
In this project, I investigated changes in health behaviors and expectations of first-year university students during their first semester. Using a longitudinal survey design, I collected data from 163 students at the beginning and end of the semester. I performed ANOVAs, repeated measures analyses, structural equation modeling, and linear regressions using SPSS and Lisrel. The study examined the impact of initial behaviors, parental influence, and living arrangements on these changes, providing insights into health behavior dynamics during the transition to university life.
